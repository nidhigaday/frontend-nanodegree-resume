# The Resume Project

## How did I complete this project?

## I used folllowing resources to get better understanding:
###1. http://api.jquery.com/ - for jQuery library and functions
###2. www.w3schools.com - for onclick function
###3. http://json.org/ and https://developer.mozilla.org - for JSON
###4. jsonlint.com/ - to validate code

##I have also made some minor changes in style.css and added custom.css for custom classes.
